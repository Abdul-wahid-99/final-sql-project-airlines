This project showcases an SQL-based database system for managing airline operations. It includes database design, queries, and optimizations for handling flight schedules, passenger information, ticket bookings, and more.

✈️ Final SQL Project - Airlines
🚀 Project Overview:
This project focuses on designing and managing a relational database system for an airline company. It includes data modeling, querying, optimization, and analysis to improve efficiency in handling airline operations.

📌 Key Features:
✅ Database Design: Well-structured ER model with tables for flights, passengers, bookings, and crew.
✅ SQL Queries: Implementation of CRUD operations, complex JOINs, and subqueries.
✅ Data Integrity: Use of Primary Keys (PK), Foreign Keys (FK), Constraints, and Indexing.
✅ Stored Procedures & Functions: Automation of tasks such as ticket booking validation and fare calculation.
✅ Performance Optimization: Query tuning using Indexes, Partitioning, and Query Execution Plans.
✅ Data Analysis: Use of Aggregate functions, Window functions, and Grouping Sets for analytics.

📊 Advanced Concepts Used:
🔹 Normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF) for reducing redundancy.
🔹 Triggers for automating actions (e.g., notifying customers about flight changes).
🔹 Views to enhance security and simplify reporting.
🔹 Transactions (ACID Properties) to ensure consistency in multi-step operations.
🔹 Indexing & Query Optimization to improve retrieval speed.
🔹 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for database security.

🛰️ Final SQL Project - DRDO
🔬 Project Overview:
This project involves a secure and optimized database system for managing Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO) operations. It handles sensitive data related to projects, personnel, funding, and security clearance.

📌 Key Features:
✅ Secure Database Design: Implementation of encryption and access controls.
✅ Classified Data Management: Handling of multi-level security (MLS) data models.
✅ Complex Queries: Use of recursive CTEs, hierarchical queries, and window functions for data retrieval.
✅ Data Integrity & Validation: Implementing triggers, constraints, and check conditions.
✅ Stored Procedures & Functions: Automating workflows for project approvals and personnel clearance.
✅ Backup & Recovery Mechanisms: Strategies for disaster recovery and point-in-time recovery.

🔐 Advanced Security & Performance Concepts:
🔹 Encryption (AES, SHA-256) for securing sensitive defense-related data.
🔹 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) & Mandatory Access Control (MAC) for data privacy.
🔹 Partitioning & Sharding for large-scale performance improvements.
🔹 Stored Procedures & Triggers for workflow automation.
🔹 High Availability & Disaster Recovery (HA/DR) using Replication & Backup Strategies.
